# _nn_from_scratch
Creating a Neural Network from scratch using only NumPy

This project will be based on the article published by Piotr Skalski
in his work on toward data science. The articles can be found here:

Essentially we will used NumPy to create a neural network from scratch to
ensure that I am comfortable with and understand the math behind a neural
network.

The goal is to write a script that is able to initialise and then train a
neural network with a prescribed architecture.

Thanks again to Piotr Skalski for his fantastic article.
